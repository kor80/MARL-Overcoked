# MARL-Overcoked
Generalization in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning remains a critical
challenge, particularly when agents must adapt to novel partners and unseen envi-
ronments. In this work, I present a purely deep RL framework for the Overcooked
benchmark which is the result of a systematic ablation study over key architec-
tural and algorithmic components - such as feature representations, and training
schedules and underlying neural architecture - to identify the combinations that
most significantly accelerate convergence and improve zero-shot generalization.
